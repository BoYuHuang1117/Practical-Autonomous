### README

Here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/BoYuHuang1117/self-driving-course/blob/master/traffic%20sign/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

I used the simple list data type to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 27446
* The size of the validation set is 11762
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is 32x32x3
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing the distribution of the training set and validation set.

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to HSV color space because 

Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after pre-processing.

The whole training set is divided into two parts. Thirty percent of it transfer to validation set.


#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 HSV image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x6 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride, valid padding outputs 14x14x6 	|
| Convolution 5x5	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x16	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride, valid padding outputs 5x5x16 	    |
| Flatten   	      	| outputs 400                               	|
| Fully connected		| input 400 output 120							|
| RELU      	      	|                                           	|
| Dropout      	      	| keep_prob 0.75 in training                   	|
| Fully connected		| input 120 output 84							|
| RELU      	      	|                                           	|
| Dropout      	      	| keep_prob 0.75 in training                   	|
| Fully connected		| input 84 output 43							|
 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an epochs as 10, batchsize as 256 and learning rate as 0.005.

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of `0.989`
* validation set accuracy of `0.979`
* test set accuracy of `0.935`

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* The first architecture was tried without dropout rate and the learning rate is set as 0.001. The validation accuracy converge slowly.
* The next try was using the same architecture but change the `batch_size` from 128 to 256. The result showed a little improvement.
* The third step was changing the `learning rate` into `0.005`. The effect was nearly the same as previous step.
* The finally adjustment made was adding dropout rate to my architecture. It significantly improved the prediction result of images I downloaded from the web pages. 
* The training accuracy is always slighty better than validation accuracy.I considered it not the overfitting but the normal behavior of the process.

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* If a model is chosen, I might create some random, fake images. Throw them into the architecture in order to see the result it give me.
 

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are only shown five out of ten German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8] ![alt text][image9]

The third image might be difficult to classify because the filter I chose in convolutional neural network might not be able to classify the exact symbol inside the red circle. Also, the image of pedestrian shown in the 32x32x3 image is too small scale for even human to correctly distinguish.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Road work     		| Road work   									| 
| Stop     			    | Stop										    |
| Pedestrians			| Speed limit (70km/h)							|
| Slippery road    		| Slippery road					 				|
| Wild animals crossing	| Wild animals crossing     					|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This result is not satisfied because I have manually found the region of interest in Microsoft painting. The best way is to automatically do the image segmentation in order to effectively spot the traffic sign. 

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

For the fifth image, the model is absolutely sure that this is a `Wild animal crossing` sign (probability of 1), and the image does contain a `Wild animal crossing` sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 1.        			| Wild animal crossing							| 
| 1.23e-15 				| Slippery road     							|
| 8.47e-17				| Double curve									|
| 3.05e-17    			| Dangerous cureve to the left	 				|
| 2.87e-18			    | Speed limit (50km/h) 							|

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
#### 1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
